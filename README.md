A WIP for hosting a modded Minecraft server on Google Cloud Platform.

I previously tried Heroku and AWS. The former gave me too little RAM, and the latter is...well, a multitool the size of a rocket that you need to hire a team of developers just to manage. GCP was a nice in-between, giving me simplicity and flexibility.
